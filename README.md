# Workout-Tracker
This app uses the Mongo database, Mongoose schema, and Express route handler to track workout data. It is deployed to Heroku.

USER STORY
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
